# Product Guidelines

## Brand Voice & Interaction
- **Silent Utility:** The application acts as a transparent conduit for the user's voice. It does not inject its own personality, prompts, or chatter. It strictly outputs the transcribed and formatted text based on the user's input.

## Visual Identity
- **Theme:** Dark Mode (High contrast, modern aesthetic).
- **Key Visual Element:** A small, centered, bottom-aligned audio visualizer serves as the primary feedback mechanism during recording.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Feedback Mechanism:** The primary interaction feedback is visual (via the audio visualizer).
- **Error Handling:** Critical errors (such as network failures or API issues) are communicated immediately via clear pop-up notifications to ensure the user is aware of why transcription might have failed.
